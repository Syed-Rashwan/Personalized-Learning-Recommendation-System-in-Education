# Personalized-Learning-Recommendation-System-in-Education

Overview
The AI-Powered Intelligent Tutoring System is an innovative educational platform designed to revolutionize the learning experience. Using state-of-the-art artificial intelligence techniques, it provides personalized learning pathways, answers student queries in real-time, and adapts dynamically to each learner's progress. By combining the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms, this platform ensures that students receive tailored educational content suited to their individual learning styles and needs.


Whether you're a student seeking help with a tough subject, a teacher looking to assist your class, or an organization aiming to implement a smart learning system, this project provides a robust, scalable solution.


Key Features
Interactive Question-Answering:


Real-time AI-driven chatbot capable of understanding and responding to subject-specific questions.
Supports multiple topics and provides accurate answers using pre-trained NLP models like GPT or BERT.
Personalized Learning Paths:


Tracks student performance and adapts the curriculum dynamically.
Recommends the next best resource or learning module based on individual progress.
Recommendation System:


Utilizes collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to suggest videos, articles, and exercises tailored to the user.
Performance Tracking:


Displays key performance metrics, such as progress graphs, quiz scores, and time spent on learning modules.
Scalability:


Designed to handle a large number of concurrent users with efficient backend and database architecture.
Technology Stack
Frontend:
React.js: For an interactive and responsive user interface.
Chart.js: For visualizing progress and performance metrics.
Bootstrap: Ensures a clean and modern UI design.
Backend:
Python (Flask/Django): Serves the AI models and manages the backend API.
FastAPI (Optional): Can be used for high-performance API services.
AI Models:
NLP:
GPT/BERT: For question-answering and generating text-based suggestions.
Recommendation System:
Collaborative Filtering: Suggests resources based on user interaction.
Matrix Factorization: For personalized recommendations.
Database:
PostgreSQL: Stores user data, including progress, quiz results, and feedback.

Setup and Installation
Prerequisites
Node.js (v16+)
Python (v3.8+)
PostgreSQL (or another RDBMS)
Git and GitHub CLI (optional)


Step 1: Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-tutoring-system.git
cd ai-tutoring-system


Step 2: Set Up the Frontend
Navigate to the frontend directory:
bash
Copy code
cd frontend
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the frontend server:
bash
Copy code
npm start


Step 3: Set Up the Backend
Navigate to the backend directory:
bash
Copy code
cd backend
Create a virtual environment:
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Start the backend server:
bash
Copy code
python manage.py runserver


Step 4: Configure the Database
Install PostgreSQL and create a database named ai_tutoring.
Update config.py in the backend to include your database credentials.


Step 5: Run the Application
Access the app in your browser at http://localhost:3000.
The backend API runs at http://localhost:8000.
